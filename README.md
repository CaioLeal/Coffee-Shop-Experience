### 📍 Why this Project?

This project was born from the idea of creating a **versatile and adaptable landing page** for any type of business. Although the current model uses the Starbucks theme, the structure was designed to be easily converted to other segments, such as Coca-Cola, restaurants, or local coffee shops.

The main technical differentiator here was the focus on organization and scalability:
* **Modular CSS Architecture:** I used style separation across several pages (navbar, home, about, etc.) to ensure cleaner code that is easier to maintain.

* **Color Management:** I implemented new ways of declaring colors through global variables, allowing for a complete change of the site's visual identity in seconds.

* **Advanced Responsiveness:** Use of functions like `clamp()` and `flexbox` to ensure the experience is flawless on any device.
